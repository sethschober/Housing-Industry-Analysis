# Processed Data

This directory contains the SQL file that is used throughout the Exploratory notebooks and contains processed versions of the Raw data.

Note that the data files are created through running the analysis so that it is not necessary to upload a database to this repository. It will be created here upon running the Jupyter notebooks.
